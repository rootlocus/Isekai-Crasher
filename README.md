# Isekai-Smasher
 
With the theme Death is only the beginning. I immedietely thought about [Isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai), where the protagonist of the real world dies and gets transported into another world for a new OP beginning. Thus, in this game you are the anime trope White Lorry driver where his job is to send protagonist to another world.
